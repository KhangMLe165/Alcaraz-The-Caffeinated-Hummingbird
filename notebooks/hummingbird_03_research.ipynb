        "\n",
        "Hummingbirds are characterized by short-duration, high-intensity bursts of activity. These bursts are not sustained outputs but peaked, transient power expenditures, often far exceeding what can be maintained continuously.\n",
        "\n",
        "**From the literature:**\n",
        "- Maximal lift production and flight effort occur in brief, discrete episodes\n",
        "- Power output is extreme relative to body mass\n",
        "- Performance is optimized for instantaneous payoff, not endurance\n",

        "Despite very high metabolic costs, hummingbirds exhibit remarkable efficiency over short time horizons:\n",
        "- Wingbeat mechanics maximize lift per cycle\n",
        "- Energy expenditure is tightly coupled to immediate functional output\n",
        "- Inefficiency is minimized within each burst, even if long-term cost is high\n",
